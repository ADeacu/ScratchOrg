{"version":"1.2.0","commands":{"deploy":{"id":"deploy","summary":"Deploy a project interactively to any Salesforce environment.","description":"This command must be run from within a project.\n\nThe command first analyzes your project, your active or logged-into environments, and local defaults to determine what to deploy and where to deploy it. The command then prompts you for information about this particular deployment and provides intelligent choices based on its analysis.\n\nFor example, if your local project contains a source directory with metadata files in source format, the command asks if you want to deploy that Salesforce app to an org. The command lists your connected orgs and asks which one you want to deploy to. The list of orgs starts with scratch orgs, ordered by expiration date with the most recently created one first, and then Dev Hub and production orgs ordered by name. If the command finds Apex tests, it asks if you want to run them and at which level.\n\nThe command stores your responses in the \"deploy-options.json\" file in your local project directory and uses them as defaults when you rerun the command. Specify --interactive to force the command to reprompt.\n\nUse this command for quick and simple deploys. For more complicated deployments, use the environment-specific commands, such as \"sf deploy metadata\", that provide additional flags.","strict":true,"pluginName":"@salesforce/plugin-deploy-retrieve","pluginAlias":"@salesforce/plugin-deploy-retrieve","pluginType":"core","aliases":[],"examples":["Deploy a project and use stored values from a previous command run:\n<%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %>","Reprompt for all deployment inputs:\n<%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --interactive"],"flags":{"interactive":{"name":"interactive","type":"boolean","summary":"Force the CLI to prompt for all deployment inputs.","allowNo":false}},"args":[],"enableJsonFlag":false,"_globalFlags":{}},"deploy:metadata":{"id":"deploy:metadata","summary":"Deploy metadata in source format to an org from your local project.","description":"You must run this command from within a project.\n\nThis command doesn't support source-tracking.

This coverage is computed for each class and trigger individually and is different than the overall coverage percentage.\n\n- RunLocalTests — All tests in your org are run, except the ones that originate from installed managed and unlocked packages.
